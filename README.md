# IMMO-Market-Extension
Simple IMMO extension that adds a checkmark next to profitable market trades based on vendor level. Mostly irrelevant now but this was a pretty big time saver when vendor 100s were in the single digits.

Simply download the XPI file and add it to your firefox extensions. (Should also work for chrome, but not as supported)
